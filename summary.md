# Summary

As could be expected, the easiest systems to recreate Stefan were those with universal or point-based character creation that are not tightly tied to a specific setting. Of those tied to specific settings, the ones closest to traditional chivalric fantasy or renaissance did better than the more unusual ones. There were some outliers, though.

Burning Wheel has a setting very close to the one Stefan originally came from, but was one of the more difficult to work with. Its life path system does not really work for conversions.

Blades in the Dark did a good job despite the setting differences, but that's mostly due to its setting conceits matching pretty closely with Stefan's situation and abilities.
