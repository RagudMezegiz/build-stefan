# Dark Heresy

Working for an inquisitor in the darkness of the 41st millennium isn't the same as being an educated con-man turned adventurer in a fantasy world. But like Blades in the Dark or even Edge of the Empire, I feel like there is a version of Stefan in that universe somewhere.

## Home World

As the closest thing to the cosmopolitan city of his original home, the obvious choice of home world for Stefan is of course the Hive World. To represent the higher point values the original character started with and try to get close to his original abilities, I use both the more experienced acolytes and point allocation rules. I concentrate all the adds on AG, INT, PER, and FEL.

---- ---  ---- ---
WS    30  INT   45
BS    30  PER   50
S     30  WP    25
T     30  FEL   45
AG    50  IFL   30
---- ---  ---- ---

Fate Threshold: 2

Teeming Masses in Metal Mountains

Aptitude: Perception

Wounds: 10

## Background

Stefan is an Outcast. I briefly consider Administratum, but like the outcast better for the underworld connections. I choose las weapons over solid projectiles, because even though solid projectiles have ammo options, las weapons are way easier to recharge.

Skills: Acrobatics, Common Lore (Underworld), Deceive, Dodge, Stealth.

Talents: Weapon Training (Chain, Las)

Equipment: Laspistol, chainsword, armoured bodyglove, injector, 2 doses Obscura

Never Quit

Aptitude: Social

## Role

Two roles are appropriate, Desperado and Seeker. Desperado is more combat-focused and Seeker has talent options more suited to Stefan's proclivities, so I go with Seeker.

Aptitudes: Fellowship, Intelligence, Perception, Social, Tech

Talent: Keen Intuition

Nothing Escapes My Sight

Stefan already has both Perception and Social aptitudes, so they get replaced with Ballistic Skill and Agility.

## Experience and Equipment

Stefan has 1,000 xp to spend. The second Seeker path describes Stefan perfectly, so I'm going to see if I can afford to buy everything on it. I'll buy all the skills at Known, then any 100 xp characteristic advances, and then look at the talents.

------- --------------------------
 200 xp Awareness
 100 xp Charm
 100 xp Inquiry
 100 xp Linguistics (High Gothic)
 100 xp Scrutiny
 100 xp Fellowship
 200 xp Clues from the Crowds
 100 xp Tech-Use
------- --------------------------

1,000 xp doesn't go very far. I probably need about twice that again to buy enough advances to feel competent. Let's see if equipment is any better. Since he already comes with basic armor and weapons, I only need to buy tools. With an Influence bonus of 3, he can get three scarce or better items. That's about enough, and I select these items:

Combat Vest, Photo Contacts, Auspex

## Finishing Up

I roll on the Divinations table, rerolling whenever I get something that doesn't fit him, and end up with *A suspicious mind is a healthy mind.* The +2 to perception doesn't help much, but the ability to reroll surprise checks is priceless.

Stefan is generally affable and easy to get along with, but you're never quite sure how sincere he is about anything. Let's go ahead and answer the questions.

### What does he desire?

Luxurious creature comforts. Not to excess, but to savor and enjoy. They're rare, so best to stretch them out and enjoy every moment of them you can.

### What does he hate?

Pompous asses who don't deserve their position or misuse their authority.

### What is he willing to sacrifice?

He's not big on sacrifice. Whenever possible, he prefers to come up with plans that save his friends and associates.

### How did he meet his Inquisitor?

He provided information as the price for not going to prison. What he thought was going to be a one-time deal turned out to be a permanent arrangement with little say in the matter. He's not exactly an indentured servant, but he's not really free to leave service, either.

### What does the Inquisitor mean to him?

Despite the unilateral changing of the deal, he has come to respect the inquisitor. He wouldn't follow suicidal orders, but has some measure of loyalty.

## Conclusion

This was obviously not going to be an exact match for the original Stefan. But does he have the right feel? Unfortunately, the answer can't be more than a solid maybe. He doesn't feel competent enough, but that might be due to the lower starting experience level of Dark Heresy characters compared to the other game lines.
