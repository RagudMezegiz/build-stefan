# Swords of the Serpentine

Swords of the Serpentine is a swords and sorcery game using the GUMSHOE system. Although it's not traditional fantasy, it does have point-buy character creation, so it probably won't be the worst system used in this exercise.

## Framing the Game

The group originally started as trusted hirelings for a criminal organization which turned out to be run by one of the city's nobles. That gives the group both criminal and noble connections, which is a perfect fit for Eversink.

## Profession

Stefan was almost but not quite a standard Thief, so I go with the custom option to mix and match from multiple professions. I'll miss out on the bonus point, but the flexibility is more important to me.

## Adjectives and Drives

For adjectives, I use the original Stefan's disadvantages and quirks as inspiration, eventually settling on cautious, flexible, inquisitive, lazy, loyal, manipulative, and persistent.

The drives are slightly harder, but I again return to the original character for inspiration.

* A full purse
* Knowing more than my enemies
* When a plan comes together

## Investigative Abilities

There were originally 5 characters in the group, but two players moved away and the core group of regulars became three. I choose to build for that 3-character core team, giving me 12 points to play with.

I want the following abilities: Charm, City's Secrets, Forgotten Lore, Liar's Tell, Ridiculous Luck, Scurrilous Rumors, Servility, Skulduggery, Trustworthy, Vigilance. That's 10 abilities, so I can raise two of them to rank 2. Or I could drop the two abilities outside the Thief profession and get that bonus point to concentrate on the Social abilities. I decide to go for the bonus, dropping Forgotten Lore and Vigilance to give me five more points to play with. Final choices are:

Charm\ 2, City's Secrets\ 1, Command\ 1, Liar's Tell\ 3, Ridiculous Luck\ 1, Scurrilous Rumors\ 1, Servility\ 2, Trustworthy\ 2

I decided to drop Skulduggery to let me improve Liar's Tell, as that's more important to the concept. I kind of also wanted Nobility and Intimidation to complete the social chameleon set, but didn't see where I could pull from. They were later additions to the character anyway, so I left the tinkering here.

### Allegiances

Allegiances are relatively easy to pick based on the original background. The Allies are Ancient Nobility\ 1 and Thieves' Guilds\ 1. The Enemy is also Thieves' Guilds\ 1.

## General Abilities

With few general abilities, one would think it's a straightforward matter to assign them. For highly-specialized characters, that's probably true. But Stefan is more of a generalist, so it takes a bit of tinkering to get a set I'm mostly happy with.

------------- ---
Athletics       5
Health          8
Morale         10
Preparedness    8
Stealth         4
Sway            8
Warfare         5

## Iconic Gear

In order to get the Grit bonus, I need at least five items of gear, but they can't be just physical possessions. I need stuff with history and connection to both Stefan and the city.

* Worn leather armor, scrounged and stolen piece by piece (Armor 1)
* Good quality deck of cards, not marked
* A small selection of useful aliases
* The rapier of Michael le Grande, former necromancer (Damage +1)
* Stack of fictitious city tunnel maps
* Old personal journal written by a nobleman from a defunct house
* Dreams of luxury not yet crushed by reality

I may have gotten slightly carried away, but I really like some of these and feel like they make for a more interesting character.

## Conclusion

Well, that went quicker than expected. It also created a rather fascinating version of Stefan that I like quite a bit. Again, he's not quite the same character, but has a very similar feel and would probably be recognizable to the gang I played him with.
