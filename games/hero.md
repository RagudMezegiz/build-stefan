# Hero System 5^th^ Edition

As a generic system, Hero System should be flexible enough to build Stefan.  But since the system's real power is only properly used in superhero games, this won't really be any kind of a test.

I decide to build Stefan as a standard heroic character, with 75 base points and a maximum of 75 points of disadvantages.

## Characteristics

Deciding how to convert characteristics from GURPS to Hero System has always been somewhat difficult.  I decide to treat his 14\ DX as a Hero System DEX of 18 and his 14\ IQ as an 18 in INT, EGO, and PRE.  Checking the minimum STR requirements of his shortsword and light crossbow indicates a minimum STR of 12 is required.  I buy a 13 as the next highest value that has any effect.

For secondary characteristics, I raise SPD to 3.  I leave everything else where it is for now.

I buy an extra inch of Running, both because Stefan had Running skill in GURPS and because it adds an inch to his half move.

That's a total of 63 points on characteristics.

## Skills

I look through Fantasy Hero to get the Everyman skill list for a generic fantasy game.  That gives him Acting, Climbing, Concealment, Conversation, Deduction, AK at 8-, Native language (illiterate), Paramedics, Persuasion, PS at 11-, Shadowing, Stealth.  Many of those are skills I'd like to have at actual levels, so the Everyman skill list doesn't really save me much.  I spend the point for Stefan to be literate and choose Scribe as Stefan's free profession.

At this stage, I buy Acting\ 13-, Animal Handler (Equines)\ 8-, Bribery\ 8-, Bugging (Eavesdropping)\ 8-, CK: Landmoor\ 11-, Concealment\ 13-, Conversation\ 13-, Forgery (Documents)\ 13-, Gambling (Card Games, Sports Betting^[I consider this the appropriate category for things like gladiatorial games and fights in general.])\ 13-, Lip Reading\ 8-, Oratory\ 13-, Persuasion\ 13-, Research\ 13-, Seduction\ 8-, Shadowing\ 13-, Stealth\ 13-, Streetwise\ 13-, Survival (Urban)\ 13-, Trading\ 8-, TF: Equines, WF: Common Melee Weapons, Common Missile Weapons.

That's a total of 49 points on skills.

## Perks and Talents

Stefan has no Perks or Talents.

## Powers and Equipment

Stefan has a Knife, Shortsword, Light Crossbow, a suit of Boiled Leather armor, and a handful of miscellaneous other equipment that doesn't necessarily count as powers.

## Disadvantages

Stefan has the Distinctive Feature of a supernatural cut in his shadow.  It's Concealable, Noticed and Recognizable, Detectable by Common Senses.

Stefan is Hunted by Santorelli's Gang.  They are More Powerful, Geographically Limited to Landmoor, and appear on 11-.

Stefan has several Psychological Limitations, but with a limit of 25\ points in any category, only the most important count for points.  Greed and Laziness make the cut.  Both are Common.  Greed is taken at Strong, Laziness at Moderate.

That's a total of 50\ points in disadvantages.  Since he's only spent 112 so far, he has enough points to cover everything he's already bought with a few points left over.

## Finishing Up

With the 13\ points I have left over, I go back and raise his Gambling to 16, CON to 13, and buy an extra inch of Swimming.

Here's the final character:

## Conclusion

It's certainly easier to create a heroic character than it is a superhero, since there aren't all those powers to worry about.  But did I successfully recreate Stefan?  The answer is a solid maybe.  I think this character has the appropriate skills, but I'm not quite sure it would feel like the same character in play.
