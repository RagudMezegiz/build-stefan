# Chivalry & Sorcery

The GURPS game the original Stefan appeared in had originally been a Chivalry & Sorcery campaign that was later converted to GURPS.  Although the original game had started with the 1^st^ edition, I'm using the 3^rd^ edition since it has a cleaner rule set.

## Choose Character Creation Method

Because the original GURPS version started out with 150 points instead of the normal 100, I'm using the Heroic Fixed Point Method to create him.

## Decide on Race

Stefan is definitely human.

## Personal Attributes

Having read ahead in the character creation process, I calculated that I needed to save 5 points to purchase things later.  I discovered later, however, that I didn't need to save any at this step.  That means I can spend all 150 points to buy my attributes.  I decide to spend the points as follows:

Attribute      Score   Cost
------------- ------- -----
Agility          18      21
Strength         12      12
Constitution     12      12
Intellect        18      21
Wisdom           18      21
Discipline       18      21
Bardic Voice     20      25
Appearance       11      11
Piety             6       6
Total                   150

I'm quite happy with these attributes.  They're very close to the original character in intent, if not actual ability.  The Heroic point total was definitely the way to go.

## Determining the Omens

Stefan defaults to Neutrally Aspected, just as he was in the original game.^[The GM created a Well Aspected advantage and a Poorly Aspected disadvantage to match the Chivalry & Sorcery flavor of the game he converted from.]  As a result, he has a BMR of 10%.

## Social Class Determination

Stefan has the default Townsman social class for no point cost.

## Determine Sibling Rank

Stefan is an unacknowledged bastard.  This provides 10 additional points.  Unfortunately, it will also lower his social status by 7.

## Determine Father's Vocation

As an unacknowledged bastard, it's actually his maternal grandfather's occupation we'll be determining.  Because he has an INT of 12+, he starts with basic knowledge in Counting as well as the Brawling skill that everyone has.

Although I'm supposed to roll on the table, one of the vocations stands out.  In his youth, Stefan learned to ride at the stables behind the College of Arcane Lore.  In retrospect, the only way that makes sense is if his grandfather owned the stables.  So I choose Stable Owner instead of rolling.

That provides the skills of Animal Handling, Riding, Veterinary, and 1 Combat Skill, which I'll choose later.  It also gives a base status of 12, which is reduced to 5 due to the bastard penalty.

## Status in One's Family

To help counteract the status reduction penalty on starting funds, I pay 5 points for Stefan to be a Good Son, which will double his starting funds.

## Talents and Abilities

To account for the scholarly environment that Stefan grew up in, I buy the Scholarship  talent for 5 points, leaving him with 0.  That gives him basic knowledge in 3 Lore skills, which I'll choose later.

## Deficiencies & Defects

In my read-ahead before buying Stefan's attributes, I originally planned to take Greedy as a defect.  However, that would also have made him tight-fisted with his money, something that doesn't fit.  Reading descriptions, I decide that I need to choose between Deep Sleeper and Vengeful.  Deep Sleeper would be a points-neutral choice, but I kind of like the idea of vengeful.  Stefan could definitely be ruthless when he thought it suited his interests, or especially when someone earned his actual enmity.

Vengeance gives him 10 extra points.

## Determine Character Size

Because Stefan was forgettably average in height and weight, I choose the exact average results for a historical male, making him 5'8" and 160 lbs.

## Body Levels

Stefan weighs 160 lbs, so his Body Level is $160 / 20 + 12 + 12 / 2 = 26$.  With his CON of 12, he recovers $0.06 \cdot 26 = 1.56$ Body Levels at total rest, $0.03 \cdot 26 = 0.78$ Body Levels at light activity, and $0.01 \cdot 26 = 0.26$ Body Levels when active.  He has an 84\% to Resist Disease, which isn't bad at all.

## Fatigue Levels

Stefan's Discipline is much higher than his Strength, so we use it to generate his Fatigue Levels.  He has $12 + 18 = 30$ Fatigue Levels, which is pretty decent.  With his CON of 12, he recovers 5FP per hour of sleep, and 2FP with a 10-minute rest.

## Lifting & Carrying

With a STR of 12, Stefan can lift $5 + 1.0 \cdot 160 = 165$ lbs.  His Carrying Capacity is half that, or 83 lbs.

## Jumping

Stefan has a jump of $0.25 \cdot (12 + 18) = 8$, plus 2 for being human gives a nice round 10.

## Moving: Walking & Running

Stefan's Intellect is much higher than his Constitution, so we use it to generate his movement rate.  He has a MOV of 18.

## Horoscope

Not remembering Stefan's actual birthday, I roll d100 and get 87.  Consulting the chart, that makes him an Aquarius.  His favored skill categories are therefore Charismatic and Lore Scientific.  Getting Charismatic was good fortune, since Stefan is supposed to be good at most of those.  If none of the scientific skills strike my fancy, I'll probably take two Charismatic skills.

## Age

The original Stefan started at age 23, which costs the remaining 10 points I have available.  He'll start with an extra 2500 experience, which will help me buy all the skills he needs.

## Personalizing Traits

I pick the "average" traits in every category to match his original appearance.  He has brown eyes, straight chestnut brown hair, average complexion, and average skin texture.  He does have one unusual feature: a supernatural cut in his shadow.

## Vocation

This one took a bit of effort to decide on.  The only standard vocation that fit Stefan's starting abilities was the Beggar specialization of Thief.  It was lacking in some of the combat skills Stefan started with, but I rather liked the wide variety of abilities.  Rather than create an appropriate Adventurer vocation, I decided to go with Beggar.

His primary vocational skills are: Streetwise, Conceal/Find Hidden, Detect Thievery, Dodge, Any Underworld Lore (Lore Historical), Begging, Conning, Disguises, Hear Rumors, Costume & Design, Sleight of Hand, Skulking in the Shadows, Pick Pockets, City Lore (Lore Historical).

His secondary skills are: Storytelling, Performance, Knife Fighting, Any 3 Legend Lore, and his background skills.  Those were Counting, Brawling, Animal Handling, Riding, Veterinary, 1 Combat Skill, 3 Lore Skills, plus all the Core Skills.

I decide to choose all the skills now.

For the Underworld Lore, I choose Regional Underworld Geography, since Local is already DF*1 and I wouldn't get any benefit.

For the 3 Legend Lore secondary skills, I choose Local History, Regional Geography, and Regional History.  These are the three that I'll most want after the ones I get from my background.

For the Combat skill, I want either Crossbow or Short Sword.  I check the Marketplace and note that a gladius or saex is expensive but affordable, while a crossbow is more than my entire starting purse.  After looking at equipment and combat, I realize that he would be far better with knives.  I deviate from the original character and choose Knife Fighting instead.  That duplicates one of the secondary skills from the vocational list, but that's okay, because I don't think Stefan will be learning any additional combat skills.

For the 3 Lore skills, I choose Own Language (Written), Local Geography, and Cartography.  These are the ones I want to start with the most.

I don't think I need any of the scientific skills, so for the favored skills I choose two Charismatic ones.  I choose Bargaining because I expect to be poor a lot, so I'll need to get good deals when I buy and sell things.  I choose Oratory for its bonus on all the other Charismatic skills.  Since I started with neither of them from a previous step, they are merely added to my vocational list, but with basic knowledge.

Now that I have my full skill lists, I can pick which ones to master.  Because the sum of Stefan's Agility and Intellect is 36, he can master four skills.  As a con man, Conning Others is an obvious choice.  I also pick Streetwise, for similar reasons.  Acting: Performance is a good choice to move to the vocational list.  To go with it, I decide to master Acting: Costuming & Make-Up as well.  If I buy Disguise later, Stefan will be pretty good at hiding in plain sight as someone unrecognizable.

So Stefan's final skill lists are (skills marked * are acquired with basic knowledge):

**Mastered (-2 DF)**\ \ \ \ \*Acting: Costuming & Make-Up (A&E), \*Conning Others (Charismatic), \*Streetwise (Thievish).

**Vocational (-1 DF)**\ \ \ \ \*Acting: Performance (A&E), \*Bargaining (Charismatic), Begging (Charismatic), City Lore (Lore Historical), Concealing & Finding Objects (Thievish), Detecting Thievery (Thievish), Disguises (Thievish), \*Dodge (Combat), Hearing Rumors (Thievish), \*Oratory (Charismatic), Picking Pockets (Thievish), Regional Underworld Geography (Lore HIstorical), Skulking in Shadows (Thievish), Sleight of Hand (A&E).

**Secondary**\ \ \ \ \*Accurate Counting (Lore Scientific), \*Animal Handling (Animal), \*Animal Riding: Horse (Animal), \*Brawling (Combat), \*Cartography (Lore Scientific), \*Knife & Dagger Fighting (Combat), Local Ancient Geographical Lore (Lore HIstorical), \*Local Geographical Lore (Lore Historical), Local History & Legend Lore (Lore Historical), Poetic Composition & Storytelling (A&E), Regional/National Geographical Lore (Lore Historical), Regional/National History & Legend Lore (Lore Historical), \*Veterinary Arts I (Animal), \*Write Own Language (Language Lore).

**Core Skills**\ \ \ \ \*Alertness-Sight (Perception), \*Alertness-Sound (Perception), \*Speak Own Language (Language Lore), \*Stamina (Athletic), \*Willpower (Mental Fortitude)

## Skills

The skills Stefan actually has, without spending any of his 7500 experience, are Accurate Counting, Acting: Costuming, Acting: Performance, Alertness-Sight, Alertness-Sound, Animal Handling, Riding Horse, Bargaining, Brawling, Cartography, Conning Others, Dodge, Knife \& Dagger Fighting, Local Geographical Lore, Oratory, Speak Own Language, Stamina, Streetwise, Veterinary Arts I, Willpower, and Write Own Language.

The first thing I want to do is buy all the skills Stefan should start with but doesn't have already.  Detecting Thievery, Disguises, Hearing Rumors, and Poetic Composition \& Storytelling from his vocational and secondary lists are definites.  To help protect him against others like him, Detect Lie and Read Character are also very important.  That costs 3300 experience. leaving 4200.

Since he's still EXL\*1 at this point, I can only raise skills to level 1 without incurring extra costs.  The obvious skills to raise at this point are Bargaining, Conning Others, Disguises, Dodge, Knife & Dagger Fighting, Oratory, and Streetwise.  That's another 3000 experience. leaving 1200.  That also brings him to EXL\*2, so he can raise some of his skills to level 2.

Raising Conning Others and Oratory to level 2 costs another 900 experience, leaving 300.  At this point, I notice that I haven't raised Hearing Rumors beyond basic knowledge.  Raising it to level 1 costs 300 experience, and that's all I have left.

Here are Stefan's final skill levels:

## Marketplace

As a townsman, Stefan starts with \pence{80} times social status, doubled for being a Good Son.  \pence{80 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 = 800} or \crown{8}.  It's not much, especially when looking at the prices of weapons and armor.  Fortunately, all characters start with some basic clothes, so I can afford to concentrate on gear I want rather than need.

Stefan's high agility means any knife is deadly in his hands.  In fact, his damage bonus is far higher than any knife's damage rating.  Two Knives will be \crown{2}.  Two average sheaths to hold them are \pence{40}.  That leaves Stefan with \crown{5.60}.

While I'm looking at clothing, I decide Stefan needs something more practical than sandals or clogs on his feet.  Infantry boots are \pence{40}, and should be suitable for any amount of walking.  A cloak, hood, and gloves rounds out the other missing pieces of his wardrobe.  These cost \pence{72 + 20 + 24 = 116}.  These bring Stefan's remaining purse to \crown{4.04}.

Writing materials would be nice to have, but most of that equipment is rather expensive.  Quills and ink aren't too bad; the problem is the paper.  The cheapest, papyrus, is \shilling{1} for a single sheet.  At 5 sheets to the crown, that's a significant fraction of the remaining funds.  I think I'll skip the writing implements for now.

Some of the camp equipment is useful even for a city dweller.  Since pockets don't really exist yet, a money belt (\pence{50}) is essential.  A one-gallon waterskin (\pence{10}) could also come in handy.  Should he actually need to go camping, he'll have to acquire extra supplies, but that should do as long as he has a roof over his head.  He has \crown{3.44} remaining.

Speaking of that roof over his head\dots long-term lodgings of average quality are \pence{40} for a room and \pence{60} for board; that's \crown{1} per month.  Stefan can afford a season's lodging, with a handful left over for miscellaneous expenses.  That seems like a decent amount to leave him with.

## Conclusion

That took a really long time.  Chivalry & Sorcery characters have a lot of fiddly bits to work out, especially in the skills.  Overall, though, I kind of like how the character turned out.  This version deviates quite a bit from the original in actual ability, but isn't too far off in spirit.
