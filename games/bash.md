# Bash! Fantasy

Bash!\ Fantasy is for swords and sorcery games rather than the more realistic world Stefan was originally from.  Given that difference, I'll lean toward a more cinematic version of the character.  Experienced is probably the closest character scale to where he originally started, so I'll have 20 points to work with.

## Stats, Race, and Age

Since it's recommended to spend 14 points on Stats, that would be a total of 7 levels.  Stefan's not particularly strong, but he is very quick and smart.  Brawn\ 1, Agility\ 3, and Mind\ 3 cost 14 points.

For race and age, Stefan is a human in his early 20s.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

For each advantage Stefan has, I'll need to balance it with a disadvantage.  I decide to look over the disadvantages first to see how many advantages I'll end up with.  In the end, I decide to take neither.

## Powers

From the Backgrounds list, Skillful seems obvious, although I'm not sure how many levels to take.  After choosing his other Powers, I decide on 2 points worth.  That will give him 4 extra skill slots.

Of the Talents, Stefan should have Armor Familiarity at 1 point, giving no penalties with leather armor.  He can be highly specialized with his crossbow by taking Expert Marksman (2 points) and Rapid Reloader (1 point).

His powers cost a total of 6 points, bringing his total to 20 points.

## Skills

With his Agility and Mind scores, Stefan has 3 physical, 3 mental, and 4 extra skill slots that can be used for either.

- Athletics/Running, Swimming
- Stealth/Hiding, Shadowing
- Deception/Lying, Manipulation
- Occultism/Monster Lore
- Streetwise x4/Gather Information, Gambling

Nine specialties and one extra multiplier use all 10 slots.  There are at least 3 slots spent on both physical and mental skills, so I don't have to worry about the penalty for swapping skill slots out for the other kind.

## Finishing Touches

With his low Brawn, Stefan has a wound threshold of 10.  His hits and energy are the standard 100 and 10, respectively.

Because Stefan is an already existing character with a background and history, I skip the other steps as they've already been determined.  Here's the final character:

Stats:

: Brawn\ 1, Agility\ 3, Mind\ 3

Powers:

: Skillful\ 2, Armor Familiarity\ 1, Expert Marksman, Rapid Reloader

Skills:

: Athletics/Running/Swimming, Stealth/Hiding/Shadowing, Deception/Lying/Manipulation, Occultism/Monster Lore, Streetwise\ x4/Gather Information/Gambling

## Conclusion

This looks like a somewhat interesting system to try out, but I'm not sure I like this version of the character very much.  He was fairly easy to create, but it doesn't quite feel like the Stefan I remember.
