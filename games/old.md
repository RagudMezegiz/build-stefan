# OLD

The fantasy game in the What's Old Is New (WOIN) game line, OLD is a fantasy toolkit more than a specific setting. Ideally, that means it should be suitable for creating a version of Stefan. However, the career rules will probably be a bit constrictive, so we'll have to see how close I can get.

## Heritage

Stefan is a Human. He gets +2 to LUCK automatically, with two additional bonuses I get to pick. I immediately put the +2 bonus into CHARISMA and the +1 into INTUITION, making them 5 and 4, respectively. I thought briefly about reversing those, but decided I wanted the charisma more.

For the three skills, I pick Bluffing, Poker (as an analogue for whatever the actual gambling card game is called), and ~~Landmoor Knowledge~~ Stealth (see below). I want the Aim exploit for the normal free one, and Quick Step is a good choice for a second to allow mobility while shooting from afar.

## Careers

The origin career is easy. Bastard is the best of the list by far. It provides INT\ +1, WIL\ +1, and CHA\ +2, bringing them to 5, 4, and 7. The two skills are Insight and Bluffing (raising it to 2). The Adaptable exploit is a no-brainer.

The next career is also a relatively easy choice: Loremaster. Stefan is rather educated. It provides LOG\ +2, WIL\ +1, and MAG\ +1, bringing them to 5, 5, and 1. For skills, I take Literature and Poker (raising it to 2) skills, and the Language Lore exploit.

It is at this point that I realize I need to have taken the Stealth skill to get into either the Assassin or Burglar careers. Assassin is the easiest way to get combat skills without joining the military or the watch, although Ruffian provides knife skill, which a shortsword can be used with. I decide to go back and take Stealth instead of local knowledge, but don't pick one of those two careers immediately.

The third and fourth career choices are Minstrel, purely for the social skills, because there is no actual con-man career. It provides INT\ +2, WIL\ +2, CHA\ +2, and REP\ +2, bringing them to 7, 7, 9, and 5. I pick the Bluffing skill again, bringing it to 3, and raise Insight twice to 3. The final skill is Carousing. I don't like any of the minstrel exploits, so I pick Lightning Reflexes and Leadership from the general list.

The final career choice is Assassin. I pick it last because it can't force me to take the Prisoner career. It provides AGI\ +1, INT\ +1, WIL\ +1, and REP\ +1, bringing them to 4, 8, 8, and 6. I take the Swords and Crossbows skills, and the Draw a Bead exploit from the general list.

For the free exploit, I choose Iron Will.

His highest attribute is Charisma and I choose the Inspiring exploit instead of rolling.

His descriptor becomes: a young, inspiring Human ex-Minstrel with questionable morals. Those questionable morals are a role-playing hook if I've ever seen one.

With a total dice roll of 6d+6, his age is somewhere between 12 and 36. I pretend that I rolled his original age of 23, so he is a young character, gaining the appropriate exploit.

## Derived Statistics

His total dice pools are listed in the final section. All his attributes provide either 2d or 3d, with his skills adding 1d or 2d, depending.

His END gives 2d and his WIL 3d, for a total of 5d Health. I roll well and get 24 Health.

His Speed is only 4. His jump is 8'/3'. With STR and END of 3, his Carry is only 60 lbs, with a maximum lift of 150 lbs.

His Initiative and Perception dice pools are 3d. For human perception, he gets to add his Insight for a total of 5d.

His Melee Defense is the minimum 10 without a weapon in hand, 11 while wielding a shortsword. His Ranged Defense is the minimum 10, plus the bonus from Lightning Reflexes, making it 12. His Mental Defense is 13 including the bonus from Iron Will. His Vital Defense is the minimum 10.

## Equipment

With REP of 3d and LUC of 2d, I roll 5d for starting money and get 14, times 20 is 280 gc.

As a city boy, he doesn't need a lot in the way of travel and camping gear. For general gear, I buy 5 Candles, Clothing, Flint and Steel, Mirror, Pouch, Satchel, Soap, and a Whetstone, for a total of 27.5 gc, leaving 252.5 gc. Paper to go in the satchel and a backpack to hold traveling gear are the first things to buy before going outside the city on an adventure.

For weapons, I buy a Shortsword, Knife, and Heavy Crossbow, for 72 gc, leaving 180.5 gc.

For armor, I buy Leather, Cap, and Leather Gauntlets, for 75 gc, leaving 105.5 gc.

## Conclusion

While I think the game system itself could be used to run a decent game, this certainly isn't recognizable as the original Stefan. I might have been able to get a bit closer by either creating a con-man career or treating it like point-buy and freely selecting the attributes, skills, and exploits without choosing careers.
