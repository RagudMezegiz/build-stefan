# Reign

Reign, like GURPS, is a point-based system. As long as there are equivalents for all the skills and advantages, I should be able to get a pretty close match.

## Stats

In GURPS, Stefan had ST\ 12, DX\ 14, IQ\ 14, HT\ 10.  In Reign, that's probably Body\ 3, Coordination\ 4, Sense\ 4, Knowledge\ 4, Command\ 4, Charm\ 4.  That's 85 points.

Stefan was always described as entirely average in appearance, even going so far as to be easily forgettable.  I'll drop Command back to 3, since it wasn't until he became experienced that he learned any performance or leadership skills.

His final stats are Body\ 3, Coordination\ 4, Sense\ 4, Knowledge\ 4, Command\ 3, Charm\ 4, for a total of 80 points.

## Skills

Stefan had quite a few skills in GURPS (45 points worth, if I remember correctly), which fortunately consolidate down to fewer skills in Reign.  I'll start by buying one die of every skill that corresponds to what he had in GURPS, then pare down or add depending on what's left over.

Body

: Athletics, Fight, Parry, Run

Coordination

: Dodge, Ride, Stealth, Weapon Skill Bows, Weapon Skill Swords

Knowledge

: Healing, Lore

Command

: Haggle

Sense

: Empathy, Expert Gambler^[I decided to put this under Sense rather than Coordination or Knowledge since most skill-based games involve reading the other players as much as knowing the game.]

Charm

: Fascinate, Graces, Lie

That's a total of 17 points.

## Advantages

Stefan had the criminal boss he worked for as a Patron.  That's about equivalent to a wealthy merchant, so 2 points.

Since Stefan had enough money to survive on, he didn't have 0 Wealth.  He started with an adequate quality crossbow and shortsword, as well as some boiled leather armor.  The weapons come with his skills, but the armor doesn't.  His Ride skill comes with a horse, however, which the original character didn't have.  Since a horse and leather armor are about the same price, I'll just trade in the horse for the armor and buy Wealth 2.

Skimming the Esoteric Disciplines, it looks like Political Whispers is in Stefan's future, but not something he started with.  None of the Martial Paths look like something he started with, either.

That's a total of 4 points for advantages.

## Finishing Up

Adding everything up, there are still 19 points left over.  Looking at his GURPS skill levels, he had several at 14, but started with nothing higher.  That's between 6 and 7 dice total skill level in Reign, so I'll go with 6 to provide room for growth.

Adding 1 die each to Bows, Dodge, Empathy, Fascinate, Gambling, Lie, and Parry costs 7 points.  But he's a really good gambler and liar, so maybe master dice are in order.  Upgrading that second die to Expert and then Master costs another 6 points each.  That uses up all 19 of the remaining points.

Here's the final version of Stefan:

**Advantages**\ \ \ \  Patron 2, Wealth 2

**Gear**\ \ \ \ Crossbow, Shortsword, Dagger, Cuirass

## Conclusion

Overall, I'm pretty pleased with how this version of Stefan turned out.  He's not an exact match, of course, but it's a pretty good fit with the spirit of the original character.  In fact, I'm pleased enough with the system's flexibility to want to try it for real.
