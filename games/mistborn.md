# Mistborn Adventure Game

The Mistborn Adventure Game is designed for playing in Brandon Sanderson's world of Scadrial.  As such, there are many assumptions written into it.  Despite Stefan originally existing in a more generic fantasy world, he has many qualities that would fit well in Scadrial.  Lets assume much of his background can exist mostly as written.

## Crew

If this were a real game, we'd start with a group discussion about the crew's cause, target, and method.  Stefan's original gang was in the employ of a crime boss who eventually revealed herself to be a noble from one of the prominent houses in the city.  Essentially, they were mercenaries working to further their patron's ends, mostly at the expense of the other criminal gangs.

## Concept

Stefan was an educated con-man and gambler.  The education was what set him apart from the average con-man.

## Important Questions

### Why did you join the crew?

Stefan joined to escape another gang who wasn't too happy with being sold fake maps to the city's underground tunnel system.  Escaping revenge is a nice motivation to join, but not really a goal he can accomplish with their help.  Retire in style, however, is a nice one.

### How did you live before you joined the crew?

Stefan was a con-man; still is, actually.  It's a fine adventuring profession.

### What special skill do you bring to the crew?

Since Stefan grew up in a school, he has a classical education.

### What is your most distinctive feature?

Stefan's most distinctive feature was that he had none.  He had a very forgettable appearance.

### How do other people describe your personality?

I'm going to skip this one, as I don't have ready access to any of the players from the original game to tell me how they see Stefan's personality.

### Do you have any special powers?

Stefan has no special powers, so he has *weak* Powers.  That gives him two extra Traits.  He's an excellent gambler ("Card Shark") and rather skilled with weapons ("trained fighter").

### Are you especially fit, smart, or charismatic?

Stefan's fit, smart, and charismatic, so he has *strong* Attributes.

### Are you well-off or do you struggle to get by?

Since *weak* and *strong* have already been used, Stefan automatically has *average* standings.

### What is the worst thing that ever happened to you?

He's wanted by a rival gang for selling fake maps of under-city tunnels.  He escaped their wrath (for now), but they're not likely to forget anytime soon.

### What do you believe is your ultimate purpose?

This will take more thought than I'm willing to put in for a minor character-building exercise.

## Define Your Strengths

There are no Powers to pick, so we move straight to Attributes.  Stefan was always well-rounded, so I'll try to split the 13 points as evenly as possible, with the odd point in Charm.

An even split for Standings would be a pair of 4s and a 3.  However, Stefan is neither wealthy nor particularly influential, but he's not below average in those areas, either.  So I set Resources and Influence to 3, and put the remaining 5 in Spirit.

## Fill in the Details

Stefan should be a skaa, since he's certainly not nobility, although he later found out that he was.  Perhaps I should go back and make his drive to discover his lineage.  And since Stefan isn't really a good skaa name, I'll throw out a few letters and make it Sten.  That sounds enough like a skaa name to fit.

Resiliences add up to Health at 7, Reputation at 8, and Willpower at 9.

With Resources of 3, he gets 3 Props: pen and blank book, leather armor, and a stout club.  The original Stefan had a sword, but that's probably less useful in a world with Allomancers.

## Conclusion

Given how simple the system is, it's not difficult to create a character that feels reasonably close to the original.  But I think I would prefer to play a character custom created specific to Scadrial if I were to play in a real game.
