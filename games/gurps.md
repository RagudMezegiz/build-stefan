# GURPS 4^th^ Edition

Stefan was originally a 3^rd^ edition character.  With all the updates and modifications between the editions, he should wind up being close but not the same.  Given the point optimizations I took advantage of originally, I expect him to be quite a bit weaker overall.

## Starting Points

In 3^rd^ edition, Stefan started out with 150 points.  Rather than figure out some ratio, I'll just start this version at 150 points as well.  That gives him a $-75$ point limit on disadvantages.

## Basic Attributes and Secondary Characteristics

The original Stefan had ST12, DX14, IQ14, HT10.  There's no way I can afford that with the new costs for DX and IQ.  I'll drop everything except HT by 1, and see if I can afford that (the answer, of course, will be no, but I'll wait until later to confirm that).  His attributes (for now) are ST11, DX13, IQ13, HT10.  He's now spent 130 of his 150 points.

His Basic Speed is 5.75, so with the expenditure of a mere 5 points, I can raise that to an even 6.0; that brings him to 135 points.  I choose a very average height and weight so he doesn't stand out in a crowd (5'8", 150 lbs.).  I leave all his other characteristics at their default values.

Stefan was 23 at the start of his career, and I see no reason to change it.  He has a perfectly average appearance and no odious personal habits or unnatural features.

Stefan gets only the free native language and cultural familiarities, and is literate in his native language.

Stefan has average wealth, no reputations, and the status of an ordinary citizen.  Since the campaign is TL3, his starting wealth is $1,000.

## Advantages

Stefan is silver-tongued, with Charisma 2 (10 points).

The original version of Stefan had the first level of Eidetic Memory, but used it almost purely for the skill multiplier benefit.  Still, it could come in handy and is now a lot cheaper, so I'll buy it here, too (5 points).  It is, however, one of the first things I'll drop if I need to shave points to afford something else.

Stefan has his crime boss lady employer as a Patron.  She's a powerful individual, but only helps on a roll of 6 or less.  Base cost 10, halved for frequency of appearance gives a cost of 5 points.

The Smooth Operator Talent is perfect for Stefan, and probably what I would have bought him had it existed when he was first created.  It's very expensive, however, which means I can't afford much.  I'll start with two levels (30 points), and then see how I have to adjust him later.

Finally, the Honest Face Perk is just too good to pass up (1 point).

That's a total of 51 points of advantages, bringing his point total to 186.  That's 36 more than I have available, so I really need some disadvantages.

## Disadvantages

Since Stefan has a Patron, I should take Duty to balance it out.  Let's use a roll of 12 or less, so that gives $-10$ points.

In his background story, he had to flee to Thessaly's service to escape the Santorelli gang, to whom he sold fake tunnel maps.  That's a fine Enemy, a medium-sized group of less-powerful people, appearing on the default 9 or less roll, for $-20$ points.

Greed is a fine disadvantage.  With the default control roll of 12 or less, it gives $-15$ points.

Stefan is also Lazy, for $-10$ points.

He has a Sense of Duty to his adventuring companions.  That's $-5$ points.

For Quirks, he has Broad-Minded, Careful, Code of Honor (Honest Gambler), Habit (Always aim crossbow before shooting), and Irreligious.

Including Quirks, his disadvantages total $-65$ points.  I can take 10 more points of disadvantages, but I'm not sure right now what will fit.  I can get an easy 7 by changing the control roll on Greed, so I do so.  That's $-72$ out of the limit of $-75$; probably close enough for now.

## Skills

Skills always take the longest to figure out, because there are so many of them.  Stefan has 36 points left to spend on skills, assuming I don't change anything that's already been purchased.  Here's the first cut at skill purchases:

--------------------------- -- ---

Search                       1  12
Shadowing                    1  12
Shortsword                   4  14
Stealth                      1  12
Streetwise                   1  14
Swimming                     1  10
Throwing                     1  12
Thrown Weapon (Knife)        1  13
Urban Survival               1  12
--------------------------- -- ---

That's exactly 36 points.  Not quite the set of skills I want, but it's close; probably close enough that I don't need to tweak it any more.

## Equipment

Stefan carries a Large Knife ($40), Shortsword ($400), and Crossbow ($150) with 12 bolts ($24) in a Shoulder Quiver ($10).  He wears Leather Armor ($100) with Heavy Leather Sleeves ($50), Leather Leggings ($40), Leather Gloves ($30), and Boots ($80), all covered by a Heavy Cloak ($50).  A helmet would be nice, but it's a lot harder to conceal.

HIs miscellaneous equipment consists of Personal Basics ($5), a Pouch ($10), and a Whetstone ($5).

His equipment totals to $994, leaving $6 worth of coin in cash.

## Conclusion

Amusingly enough, this is pretty much the character I envisioned when I created Stefan the first time.  But then, I shouldn't be surprised that GURPS is a suitable system in which to recreate a GURPS character.
