# Tri-Stat dX

Like GURPS, Tri-Stat dX is a generic, points-based system.  In theory, Stefan should be fairly straightforward to recreate.  Skimming the list of campaign types, Low Fantasy is the closest to the original game, so the dice are set to d6.  Point total for d6 games is 50--75 points.  Rather than set a specific point value now, I'll wait until after I see how many points I need before deciding.

## Stats

Stefan is capable across the board, so he should have good values in all three stats.  Setting all three stats to 7 costs 42 points.

## Attributes

Since Stefan is not a mage, his attributes are fairly simple.

Gadgets

: Stefan has a handful of useful items.  Shortsword, Crossbow, Light Armor, Writing Implements, and four more unspecified minor gadgets all fit within a single level of the attribute, for a cost of 2 points.

Highly Skilled

: Stefan has a much larger variety of skills than the average person, although they're all at fairly low levels.  His skills require 20 points beyond the norm, which equates to 2 levels at a cost of 2 points.

Organizational Ties

: Stefan is a member of a criminal gang which, in the grand scheme of things, is pretty minor.  He's well-liked, although not very high ranking, so 3 levels is probably sufficient.  That costs 3 points.

His attributes come to 7 points, bringing his total to 49 points.

## Skills

For a human-level game, Stefan starts with 20 skill points.  That's not nearly enough, so he has 2 levels of the Highly Skilled attribute, which provides 20 additional points.  Using the low fantasy skill costs, here are Stefan's skills:

**Skill**                       **Lvl**   **Pts**
------------------------------ --------- --------
Area Knowledge (Landmoor)          1            3
Etiquette (Middle Class)           1            2
Gaming (Gambling)                  1            2
Occult (Astrology)                 1            2
Riding (Horse)                     1            3
Stealth (Silent Movement)          1            3
Street Sense (Landmoor Gangs)      1            2
Swimming (Free Diving)             1            3
Urban Tracking (Underworld)        1            1
Archery (Crossbow)                 1            6
Melee Attack (Sword)               1            5
Melee Defense (Sword)              1            5
Thrown Weapons (Blades)            1            3

## Defects

Wanted is the only defect that fits.  The reward isn't high enough for anyone other than the criminals who desire it to hunt him, so 1\ BP level is appropriate.

His defects provide 1 bonus point, bringing his total down to 48 points.  Assuming I set his total points at 50, that leaves 2 points with which to buy something else.  More ranks of Highly Skilled would be nice, but I did a good job of capturing his core competencies with his existing skills.  I finally decide on a single level of Defence Combat Mastery, which exactly uses up those 2 points.

## Derived Values

Stefan's combat value is easy to calculate.  All his stats are 7, so his Attack Combat Value is 7.  His Defence Combat Value is 6 after adjusting for his Defence Combat Mastery attribute.

Stefan's Body and Soul are both 7, so he has 70 Health Points.  Stefan's Mind and Soul are also both 7, so he has 70 Energy Points as well.  His Shock Value is 14.

## Conclusion

That was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  I was certain I'd need closer to the top of the points range to fit everything in.  Tri-Stat dX is very flexible, and just simple enough to not require a lot of contortions to get the character you're trying for.
