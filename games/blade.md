# Blade of the Iron Throne

Blade of the Iron Throne is a swords and sorcery game rather than the typical fantasy, so I expect there to be some significant differences between the original and this version.

## Talents

Since this isn't for a real game in a custom world, I use the default talent table.  It's fairly easy to select the Sorcery and Culture picks; they get D and E, respectively.  The most difficult decision comes next: what gets the F slot?  The idea of 3--4 Poor Assets^[Three is the actual number, but a fourth would need to be selected to allow Stefan to have the Literacy Asset.] doesn't strike me as appropriate, but the other option would be no combat proficiencies.

After much thought, and a whole bunch of simple procrastination, I go with these priorities: A for Attributes, B for Skills, C for Proficiencies, D for Sorcery, E for Culture, F for Assets.

### Sorcery

Mundane is closest to Stefan's original background, since he isn't an actual sorcerer of any sort.

### Culture

Landmoor is fairly decadent, and being from a decadent culture was far preferable to being cursed.  It provides a $-1$ to Tenacity.  I also have a choice between a $-1$ to Brawn or an additional Poor Asset.  Not caring for the decadent choices, I take the $-1$ to Brawn.  Both Tenacity and Brawn are limited to a maximum value of 7.

### Attributes

Stefan has 34 points to spread among the 6 Attributes.  I choose Heart as his focus.  The points are split fairly evenly, winding up with the following values: Brawn\ 4 ($5-1$), Daring\ 5, Tenacity\ 5 ($6-1$), Heart\ 6, Sagacity\ 6, Cunning\ 6.

As this is just an exercise and not a real character, I skip the Passion Attributes.  In a real game, I'd probably put 1 point in each Passion and leave 3 for Drama.

His Combined Attributes are Reflex\ 6, Aim\ 6, Knockdown\ 5, Knockout\ 5, Move\ 5.

### Skills

The 33 points provided by the B pick seems like a lot until counting up how many skills Stefan should have.  I strip him down to his bare con-man essence, plus his background skills.  Few skills are as high as I would like.

His skills are: Apothecary\ 2, Climbing\ 2, Decipher\ 3, Etiquette\ 1, Falsehood\ 5, Information Gathering\ 5, Negotiation\ 3, Riding\ 2, Sneaking\ 3, Swimming\ 2, Trailing\ 5.

### Proficiencies

With a C pick, I have 8 points to spend on Proficiencies.  To match the GURPS weapon skills, Stefan would need 5 separate proficiencies: brawling, cut & thrust, dagger, crossbow, thrown knife.  Since brawling defaults from dagger and vice versa, I can make do with only one of those.

His proficiencies are: Cut &\ Thrust\ 3, Dagger\ 2, Crossbow\ 3, Thrown Knife\ 2.

### Assets

As the F pick, I've got to select three Poor Assets.  I add a fourth to allow Stefan to be literate.  The Connection is obvious, representing his original enemy.  In a real game, I would buy the Good versions of all these as soon as possible, then buy off the Poor ones.

His Assets are: Good Literacy, Poor Cautious, Poor Connection, Poor Shadow, Poor Superstitious.

## Other Details

Most of the details aren't particularly relevant for an exercise of this sort.  I do note that his primary Melee Pool is 9 (from Cut & Thrust), as is his Archery Pool (from Crossbow).

## Finishing Up

Here's the final character:

Attributes:

: Brawn\ 4, Daring\ 5, Tenacity\ 5, Heart\ 6, Sagacity\ 6, Cunning\ 6\
Reflex\ 6, Aim\ 6, Knockdown\ 5, Knockout\ 5, Move\ 5

Skills:

: Apothecary\ 2, Climbing\ 2, Decipher\ 3, Etiquette\ 1, Falsehood\ 5, Information Gathering\ 5, Negotiation\ 3, Riding\ 2, Sneaking\ 3, Swimming\ 2, Trailing\ 5

Proficiencies:

: Cut & Thrust\ 3, Dagger\ 2, Crossbow\ 3, Thrown Knife\ 2

Assets:

: Good Literacy, Poor Cautious, Poor Connection, Poor Shadow, Poor Superstitious

## Conclusion

I think I would like to try the game, but I probably wouldn't use Stefan as a model for my character.  As far as how well the system recreated Stefan, the answer is not very.  The priority method of creation is great for the swords and sorcery genre, but doesn't do so well at duplicating the feel of a really well-rounded point-based character like Stefan.
