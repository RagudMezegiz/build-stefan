# Mutants and Masterminds

At its heart, Mutants and Masterminds is a superhero game.  However, it's also suitable for cinematic-style fantasy games thanks to the Warriors and Warlocks sourcebook.  Since it's a straight points-based game, I expect Stefan to be fairly easy to recreate.  I'll try starting at PL\ 6.

After a first attempt, getting as far as feats, I realized that even at PL\ 6, Warriors and Warlocks characters are more competent than starting GURPS characters.  I decided to try to recreate the master gambler/con man/diplomat with expert fighting skills that Stefan grew into.

## Abilities

After a bit of tweaking, Stefan's ability scores are STR\ 14, DEX\ 18, CON\ 12, INT\ 18, WIS\ 18, CHA\ 18.  I left his saving throws alone, but put both Attack and Defense bonuses equal to the PL.

## Skills

I intend for Stefan to have the Eidetic Memory and Jack of All Trades feats, so he can use any skill untrained.  That way I don't have to spend one skill rank on every skill I want him to be able to use.  I can concentrate on the skills he's really good at.

I buy Bluff, Diplomacy, Gamble, Intimidate, and Sense Motive up to +10.  I buy Forgery up to +8 and Research up to +6.  I leave the rest at default, which is +4 for almost everything.  I also buy eight extra languages, which I'll select later.

## Feats

I run through the feat list one item at a time, and select every one that fits, knowing full well that I might have to remove a few after working out his equipment.

Beginner's Luck, Challenge---Lip Reading, Defensive Attack, Eidetic Memory, Fascinate (Bluff), Jack of All Trades, Martial Artist, Master Plan, Quick Draw, Skill Mastery (Bluff, Gamble, Intimidate, Sense Motive), and Track.

## Powers

The Device power is used to build all his magic items.  Given the large amount of time he'd been adventuring, he'd accumulated far more magic items than he had PP to buy.  I decided to just call them all "borrowed" items, so he could get them for free.

## Equipment

The same thing applied to his equipment; he was more than wealthy enough through his adventures to own pretty much any piece of mundane equipment he wanted.

## Finishing Up

Despite all the worry about spending too many points, there were still 6 points left over.  I went back to his saving throws and added all the points there, making his saving throws +5 across the board.

Here's the final version of Stefan:

Abilities:

: STR\ 14, DEX\ 18, CON\ 12, INT\ 18, WIS\ 18, CHA\ 18, Fort\ +5, Ref\ +5, Will\ +5, ATK\ +6, DEF\ +6, Tough\ +1

Skills:

: Bluff\ +10, Diplomacy\ +10, Forgery\ +8, Gamble\ +10, Intimidate\ +10, Languages\ 8, Research\ +6, Sense Motive\ +10

Feats:

: Beginner's Luck, Challenge---Lip Reading, Defensive Attack, Eidetic Memory, Fascinate (Bluff), Jack-of-All-Trades, Martial Artist, Master Plan, Quick Draw, Skill Mastery (Bluff, Gamble, Intimidate, Sense Motive), Track

Languages:

: TBD (Native + 8 remaining)

Equipment:

: A whole crapton of magic items and normal equipment

## Conclusion

This version of Stefan turned out fairly close to what I was looking for once I realized how far the points were going to go.  I'd probably be willing to play this version in a game someday.  Depending on the campaign in question, I'd probably drop the number of languages in favor of other skills or equipment allowance.
