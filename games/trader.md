# Rogue Trader

Space adventures in pursuit of profit in a universe where the very act of space travel itself can expose you to horrors man was not meant to know. Welcome to Rogue Trader, another of the odd games that seem like an odd setting in which to try to recreate a fantasy character. But like the pirate version in Edge of the Empire, his rogue-ish nature might be a good fit for a crew.

## Generate Characteristics

As usual, when a game provides the option for allocating characteristics, I'm using that method. Although even 100 points isn't likely to let me get the scores I want, I do my best.

--- ---  ---- ---
WS   30  Int   40
BS   35  Per   40
S    30  WP    40
T    30  Fel   40
Ag   40
--- ---  ---- ---

These scores aren't what I want, but they're probably as close as I can get. That's the problem with breadth rather than depth; you're never as good as you want to be. If I recall correctly, that was mostly true about original Stefan's early adventures as well.

## Origin Path

### Home World

The obvious choice of home world for Stefan is a Hive World. Unfortunately, that lowers his Toughness by 5, but Fellowship gets an equivalent boost. He can speak his hive's dialect and use technology as basic skills, ignore crowds for movement purposes, suffers penalties in the great outdoors, and gets a bonus to initiative. I roll 1d5+5 and get 7 wounds. A roll of 7 nets 3 Fate Points.

### Birthright

Going back to the original Stefan's education, I choose Savant as his birthright. I take the Logic skill and double-down on the Fellowship bonuses. Unfortunately, this choice comes with another reduction in Toughness.

### Lure of the Void

Of the options available, the best appears to be Chosen by Destiny. I pick the Xenophile option. I thought about Seeker of Truth, where I would have chosen the Ecclesiarchy as the enemy, but didn't like the Willpower penalty.

### Trials and Travails

I readily choose Dark Voyage for this option and select the Resistance (Fear) Talent. Rolling 1d5, I get 4 Insanity Points.

### Motivation

Based purely on the effects that they provide, I select Prestige and the Talented Talent. Looking over the skill list, I pick Deceive.

### Career

Seneschal is the career that seems most appropriate. In addition to what he already has acquired, he gets the Seeker of Lore special ability and the following skills, talents, and gear:

Skills: Barter, Commerce, Common Lore (Underworld), Deceive, Evaluate, Forbidden Lore (Archeotech), Inquiry, Literacy, Speak Language (Low Gothic, Trader's Cant)
Talents: Basic Weapon Training (Universal), Pistol Weapon Training (Universal)
Gear: Best-Craftsmanship Hellpistol, Best-Craftsmanship Hellgun, Xeno-mesh armour, autoquill, dataslate, micro-bead, multikey, two sets of robes, synskin, chrono, cameleoline cloak

## Spend Experience

With the 500 xp I have to spend, I buy all 3 of the 100 xp characteristic advances and the Unremarkable talent.

## Conclusion

This feels closer to what Stefan should be, although there was far less opportunity to customize options than I was expecting, so I lucked out in that the choices available provided the skills and talents I was looking for, although they were not quite an exact match.
