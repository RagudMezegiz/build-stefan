# Burning Wheel

Burning Wheel is a life path system, so I expect there to be some disconnect between the original and this version of Stefan.

## Life Paths

The first two life paths were fairly easy.  I know he was born and raised in a city (City Born), and spent his childhood in a place of learning (Student).  Confidence Man was a perfect fit for his third life path.  When I got to the fourth, I ran into a problem.

Criminal was the "correct" life path, but it didn't have the weapon skills that the original character started with.  City Guard had the right mix of skills and abilities, and wasn't that far off from what he was actually doing.  He was just working for another criminal gang instead of the proper authorities.  Guard was also a prerequisite for Duelist, which was where his career went shortly after play began.^[I know that once a Burning Wheel character starts play, the life path prerequisites don't matter any more, but I was trying to keep as close to the original character as I could.]

1. City Born
2. Student
3. Confidence Man
4. City Guard

Adding up the time for those paths puts his age at 25, which is not that far from the original 23.

## Stats and Attributes

With only a single bonus point of each type (from Student and City Guard), I had a total of 8 mental and 17 physical points to play with.  Since he was always a well-rounded character, I split the mental points evenly; he wasn't as smart as the original, but it was the best I could do.  I put Agility at 6, Power at 3, and the remaining physical stats at 4.

His stats are Will\ B4, Perception\ B4, Power\ B3, Forte\ B4, Agility\ B6, Speed\ B4.

Health is 4, and with no bonuses or penalties from the questions, it stays there.  Guard doesn't count as a soldier life path, but he did have a competitive upbringing, so Steel is also 4.  His agility isn't high enough by itself to raise Reflexes to 5, so that's 4 as well.  Mortal Wound is 9.

His attributes are Reflexes\ B4, Steel\ B4, Health\ B4, Mortal Wound\ B9.

## Skills

Adding up the skill points gave a total of 21, plus 4 general.  The required skills were Read, Falsehood, and Brawling.  Read and Falsehood start at 2, Brawling at 3, for a total of 3 points.  Opening City-Wise, Crossbow, Inconspicuous, Persuasion, Streetwise, Sword, and Write cost another 7 points.  After spending the rest of the points, here are the final skill levels:

Skill           Open + Add  = Final
-------------- ------------ --------
Brawling           3 + 0    = B3
City-Wise          2 + 0    = B2
Crossbow           3 + 1    = B4
Falsehood          2 + 3    = B5
Inconspicuous      2 + 2    = B4
Persuasion         2 + 2    = B4
Read               2 + 0    = B2
Streetwise         2 + 2    = B4
Sword              3 + 1    = B4
Write              2 + 0    = B2

The general points go toward skills he should have but weren't on the life path lists: Forgery and Gambling.  One point each to open them, plus two more on Gambling put them at B2 and B4, respectively.  They're lower than I'd like, but you make do with what you have.

## Traits

His life paths provide 4 points for traits, with none required.  His background provides plenty of options for trait purchases, but two really stand out: Plain Faced and Poker Face.  They cost 2 points each, which is exactly what he has.

## Resources

The life paths provide a total of 36 resource points.  That's not a bad haul.

For relationships, we get his mother (Minor, immediate family, 3 points) and a member of the enemy crime gang (Minor, hateful/rival, 3 points).

For gear, he gets Run of the Mill Arms, Crossbow, Leather Armor, Clothes, Shoes, Paper, and Quills/Ink, for a total of 20 points.  That leaves 10 points left over.

He can only afford a single 1D Affiliation with the gang he's in, using up the last of his resource points.  Since no modifiers apply, his Circles attribute is B2.

With only 10 resource points spent on the appropriate things, his Resources attribute is B0.

## Finishing Up

If I were actually going to play Stefan in a game, I'd come up with beliefs and instincts for him, but since this is just a building exercise, I'll skip it for now.

## Conclusion

I'm not particularly fond of this version of Stefan.  The whole time I was working on this character, I felt constrained by the system.  I don't think this game is well-suited to recreating characters from other games.  It's designed for creating characters from scratch without preconceived notions of who they are before you start down the life paths.  It excels at growing characters organically, and I don't think I'd want to use it any other way.
