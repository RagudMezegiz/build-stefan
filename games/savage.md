# Savage Worlds

Savage Worlds is sort of a point-based system.  Each category of thing has its own pool of points to work with.  It's flexible enough that it should be capable of building Stefan, though.

## Attributes

Stefan's attributes should probably be d8 for both Agility and Smarts, and d6 for everything else.  Unfortunately, that's 2 attribute points more than a starting character has.  I can probably get one of them to d8 by using hindrances to get extra attribute raises, but the other will have to stay at d6.  I'll wait until after picking skills to decide which one to raise.

## Skills

I'll start by buying d4 in every skill that he should have.  As expected, he has a lot of skills.  He has too many to buy any of them to high levels.  With 12 skills, he can only raise three of them to d6: Fighting, Gambling, Shooting; the rest stay at d4.

Shooting         d6
Stealth          d4
Streetwise       d4
Swimming         d4

## Edges and Hindrances

Let's pick the hindrances first.  Skimming the list, Cautious and Enemy look good.  Stefan was originally Greedy, but later bought it off.  He was also Lazy.  Lazy is a minor quirk, and probably not worth a hindrance.  Since his enemy was a whole gang, it will be major so Greedy can be taken at the minor level.

Stefan gets a free edge.  Charismatic is the one that most closely resembles his original abilities, but that requires a Spirit of d8.  I'll use two of his reward points to raise Spirit to d8 and take the edge.

That leaves 2 reward points.  None of the other edges match anything he had at the start of his career, although several are on the list of likely advances.  So he can either raise another attribute, or two skills.  Let's go with the skills, and put both points into Persuasion, raising it the the d8 limit of his Spirit.

## Gear

Stefan originally started play with Leather Armor, a Shortsword, and a Crossbow.  Since the Crossbow costs the whole starting amount, he can't afford the set.  Going back to the reward selection, dropping Persuasion back to d6, and using the reward point to add cash allows him to have the gear he needs.  A few other miscellaneous pieces of equipment and I'm done.

## Finishing Up

Here's the "final" version as I've worked him out here.

## Conclusion

Beginning characters in Savage Worlds are clearly lower in ability than starting GURPS characters.  Stefan is two attribute levels and probably six skill levels short of where I'd like him to be.  That would be five advances, and would use up the attribute advances from both Novice and Seasoned ranks.  I think I could be happy starting at Seasoned level with only four advances.

I'm not displeased with how Stefan turned out, but I'm not particularly pleased, either.  Savage Worlds is definitely designed for "zero to hero" games, and at starting levels it shows.
