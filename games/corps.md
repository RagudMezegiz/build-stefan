# CORPS

As it's a generic system like GURPS, it seems reasonable that CORPS would also be flexible enough to allow building a version of Stefan.  The first edition of the game was designed for modern conspiracy games, so I'm using the second edition for this exercise.

## Character Points

Given that the original character was created on a heroic level of points, I decide that the cinematic point totals of 150\ AP and 100\ SP are probably the most appropriate.  If I need the high fantasy point totals, I can always change it later.

## Attributes

The average man template costs 99\ AP.  I start with that, then raise AGL, AWR, and WIL from 4 to 6, for a total cost of 60 additional AP.  Stefan's attributes cost a total of 159\ AP.

## Skills

I decide to use the high fantasy skill tree, as that's the existing tree that makes the most sense.  I start by purchasing every skill I think he should have at one level past aptitude, then increase to take up the remaining balance after figuring advantages and disadvantages.  His final skills are on his character sheet.

## Ads & Disads

Stefan is 23 years old, giving him an extra 14\ AP and 28\ SP.  His background is worth 2\ SP.

Santorelli's gang is a Level 2 Enemy, which provides an additional 10\ SP.

Stefan has a good memory, which counts as a Physical Ad that costs 5\ AP.

Stefan has the Level 1 Psych Lim of Greed, worth 2\ SP.

Without spending any AP or SP on Wealth, Stefan can have 6 years of gambling winnings saved up, for a total of 4320Cr savings and 8640Cr worth of possessions.

He has a STR\ 5 crossbow, knife, short sword, hardened leather armor, and various other sundries, which all add up to well less than his possession allowance.

## Finishing Up

Here's the final character:

Stefan has 2\ ASP saved up.  In a game that didn't use ASP, I could spend them on a couple more secondary or tertiary skills.

## Conclusion

This isn't a bad version of the character.  He's a lot wealthier than the original character, but I could always reduce his starting wealth to what would be based on his AWR by itself instead of treating gambling as an actual job.  He'd still be able to afford his starting equipment.

I think his abilities are quite similar to the original, and would probably feel about the same in play.
