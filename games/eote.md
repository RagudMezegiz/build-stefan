# Edge of the Empire

At first, Edge of the Empire seems like an odd pick for a game system in which to recreate Stefan.  However, nearly all of his background bits are easily modified to fit within the Star Wars universe.

## Background

He's the illegitimate son of a pirate.  Although he never met his father, his father sent money until he died or was captured by authorities (which probably amounts to the same thing in the end).  He grew up in an independent-minded cosmopolitan area, perhaps some place like Correlia.  He chose gambling and confidence games as a profession out of a desire to avoid labor, academics, or some other boring career.

## Obligation

Assuming he starts his adventuring career in much the same state as the original character, the obligations of Bounty and Favor are closest to his original disadvantages.  The Bounty would have been placed on him by the criminals he tried to con, while the Favor would be owed to the criminals he wound up working for.  Favor's probably better for long-term story purposes, so I choose that.  Assuming he'd be in a group of total size 4--5, starting value is 10.

## Species

Stefan was originally a human, although he came from a game world with very few other races.  Still, as a generalist, he benefits from the human's ranks in non-career skills.  Since I haven't picked my career yet, I'll hold off on picking those.

## Career and Specializations

After skimming through all the careers and specializations available, the Smuggler (Scoundrel) combination seems to be closest to the original character concept.  For the free skill ranks, I need Deception, Perception, and Streetwise.  For the last, I have trouble choosing between Coordination, Skullduggery, and Vigilance.  After reading through the skill descriptions in detail, I finally settle on Vigilance.  The other two skills are fairly high on the list of ones to buy with starting XP.

For the two free ranks in specialization skills, I take Charm and double up on Deception.

## Invest Experience Points

As a human, Stefan has 110 XP.  After lots of deliberation, back and forth, toying with the math, and taking additional Obligation for 10 extra XP, I wind up making the following purchases:

- Agility to 3 (30 points)
- Cunning to 3 (30 points)
- Presence to 3 (30 points)
- Cool 1 (5 points)
- Piloting (Space) 1 (5 points)
- Ranged (Light) 1 (5 points)
- Skullduggery 1 (5 points)
- Black Market Contacts (5 points)
- Convincing Demeanor (5 points)

Now that I've spent all my XP, I finally go back to figure out which two non-career skills I want for being human.  Athletics is one that would be nice to have, although Stealth is probably more useful overall, so I go with that.  As for the other, I choose Knowledge: Lore.  It's a nod to his original background, and something he easily could have learned growing up around scholars.

## Derived Attributes

His Brawn and Willpower are both 2, so his Strain and Wound thresholds are both 12.  He has Defense of 0, and Soak of 2.  Some armor would be nice, but I'll bet he can't afford any with starting funds.

## Motivations

Looking over the motivations, Ambition (Greed) is the one that most closely matches the original character, although Relationship (Place of Origin) is also applicable.  Favor and Relationship go well together as a connected Obligation/Motivation pair, so I finally decide on that one.

## Gear

Gear is pretty simple: Light Blaster Pistol (300), Heavy Clothing (50), Commlink (25), Sabacc Deck (40), Datapad (75), and Glow Rod (10).  That's everything, so he'll only have the random roll for starting cash.

## Finishing Up

Since I'm not playing him in a group, I skipped the part about choosing the group's starting ship.  I also assumed the group size in order to figure out how much Obligation he started with, which set the limit on how much extra Obligation he could take for XP.  Here's the final character:

Abilities:

: Brawn\ 2, Agility\ 3, Intellect\ 2, Cunning\ 3, Willpower\ 2, Presence\ 3

Attributes:

: Strain Threshold\ 12, Wound Threshold\ 12, Defense\ 0, Soak\ 2

Skills:

: Charm\ 1, Cool\ 1, Deception\ 2, Knowledge: Lore\ 1, Perception\ 1, Piloting (Space)\ 1, Ranged (Light)\ 1, Skullduggery\ 1, Stealth\ 1, Streetwise\ 1, Vigilance\ 1

Talents:

: Black Market Contacts\ 1, Convincing Demeanor\ 1

Equipment:

: Commlink, Datapad, Glow Rod, Heavy Clothing, Light Blaster Pistol, Sabacc Deck

## Conclusion

This actually isn't a bad character.  The 110 XP he started with didn't go as far as I thought they might, especially when it came to raising abilities.  I had to make some tough choices to squeeze in the essentials, but I think I'm reasonably happy with him.

He has several shortcomings compared to the original.  He's not as smart, but this game doesn't use IQ for social skills like GURPS does.  Cunning and Presence were better abilities to represent his natural talents, so I let the Intellect stay at average.  I would have liked a higher Willpower, too, but there were only so many points.

It's not quite the original Stefan, but it wasn't supposed to be.  He's a great Stefan-inspired character, however, that I would be happy to play should someone ever run an Edge of the Empire game.
