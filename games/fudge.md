# Fudge

Using Fudge to create Stefan is almost cheating, because it's supposed to be flexible enough to do anything.  In order to avoid doing a straight conversion from the original GURPS version, I was going to use the Fantasy Fudge rules to create him.  But when I got to the first step of spending skill points, he needed skills from every list, which takes more points than you get.  So I decided to make a conversion based on my recollection of the original character and then tweak it.

## Attributes

Using the GURPS attributes of Strength, Dexterity, IQ, and Health, Stefan has them at Fair, Great, Great, and Fair, respectively.  That's 4 attribute levels.  I'll wait until after I've finished the rest of the character to decide whether I have to balance them with flaws or trades from another category.

## Skills

I'm going to treat all the skills on Stefan's list as falling into the "Most skills" cost category, since none of them strike me as particularly easy or difficult to learn.  Using the suggested skill list in the Skills, Gifts, and Faults chapter, this is what I wind up selecting:

Skill                      Level     Cost
-------------------------- -------- -----
Acting                     Good         3
Animal Handling            Fair         2
Area Knowledge (Landmoor)  Fair         2
Brawling                   Fair         2
Carousing                  Good         3
Concealment                Fair         2
Crossbow                   Good         3
Detect Lie                 Good         3
Fast-Talk                  Great        4
Find Hidden                Fair         2
Gambling                   Great        4
Intimidation               Good         3
Jumping                    Fair         2
Knife                      Fair         2
Knife Throwing             Fair         2
Knowledge (Literature)     Fair         2
Lie                        Great        4
Literacy                   Fair         2
Merchant                   Fair         2
Observation                Fair         2
Occult Knowledge           Fair         2
Persuasion                 Great        4
Research                   Fair         2
Riding                     Fair         2
Running                    Mediocre     1
Stealth                    Fair         2
Streetwise                 Fair         2
Swimming                   Fair         2
Sword                      Fair         2
Tailing                    Fair         2
Throwing                   Fair         2
Total                                  74

That's 4 Great skills, 5 Good skills, and no Superb skills.  Aside from the quantity, there's nothing particularly outstanding about the skill list.  Again, I plan to wait until the end to decide how to balance the points spent.

## Gifts and Faults

For gifts, I select Charisma and Patron.  For faults, I select Enemy, Greedy, Lazy, and Loyalty.  That's two gifts and 4 faults.

## Trading Traits

Assuming 2 free gifts, half the number of attributes in free levels, and 60 points for skills, I can make the following trades:

- 1 fault for 2 attribute levels
- 3 faults for 18 skill levels

That gives me 4 more skill levels.  With those, I'll raise Observation, Stealth, and Sword to Good and raise Running to Fair.

## Finishing Up

Here's the final character:

Attributes:

: Great Dexterity, IQ\
  Fair Strength, Health

Skills:

: Great Fast-talk, Gambling, Lie, Persuasion\
  Good Acting, Carousing, Crossbow, Detect Lie, Intimidation, Observation, Stealth, Sword\
  Fair Animal Handling, Area Knowledge (Landmoor), Brawling, Concealment, Find Hidden, Jumping, Knife, Knife-throwing, Knowledge (Literature), Literacy, Merchant, Observation, Occult Knowledge, Research, Riding, Running, Streetwise, Swimming, Tailing, Throwing

Gifts:

: Charisma, Patron (Thessaly Silius)

Faults:

: Enemy (Santorelli Gang), Greedy, Lazy, Loyalty (Companions)

## Conclusion

This is really close to a straight translation, and doesn't really showcase what Fudge is capable of.  But it is a fairly good recreation of Stefan.  It's not quite as simple as I was originally expecting, probably because I limited myself to using the objective character creation system.  The subjective system with some limits would probably make a better version of any character with a strong concept.
