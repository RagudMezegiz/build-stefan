# H창rnMaster

I already know in advance that this will not be a faithful recreation of Stefan. I have enough experience with the system to know that it does not support a character like him that doesn't fit neatly into a single profession.

To make the task less sisyphean, I will use the optional character design system with the full 50 CPs to let me pick everything.

## Birth Attributes

Stefan is a male human without needing to spend any CPs.

I spend 5 CPs to set his birthday to Savor 2, which makes him a Tarael-Tai cusp. This provides the maximum bonus to social and lore skills in an attempt to make up for H창rnMaster's lack of GURPS-like advantages.

Cherafir in Melderyn is probably the most cosmopolitan city in all of H창rn, so is the closest analogue to Stefan's original home of Landmoor. He is from a city, which makes him a freeman, so unguilded is the correct social class.

## Family Development

Stefan is an only child and a bastard. He is not acknowledged, and in fact not even his mother knows the true identity of his father.^[Count Meron the Sea King turned out to be his father, but that wasn't discovered until long after Meron's death. Stefan was never formally acknowledged by his father, but was accepted by the family.]

I roll for estrangement and relation to clanhead, since those aren't part of the point costs. Stefan is popular, but distantly related. The clanhead is his mother's uncle.

## Appearance Attributes

Stefan is of average height and medium build (0 CP). His actual height and weight are 5'8" and 153 lbs.

I spend 1 CP to set Stefan's comeliness to 10, which is dead center of average.

## Physical Attributes

I buy the following levels for a total of 30 CPs. I take no rolls on the medical table.

Strength
: 12 (4)

Stamina
: 10 (2)

Dexterity
: 14 (6)

Agility
: 14 (6)

Eyesight
: 14 (3)

Hearing
: 14 (3)

Smell
: 12 (2)

Voice
: 16 (4)

## Personality Attributes

I buy the following levels for a total of 14 CPs. I take no rolls on the psyche table.

Intelligence
: 14 (6)

Aura
: 10 (2)

Will
: 14 (6)

Morality
: 10 Corruptible

Stefan is heterosexual.

## Deity

Stefan is not particularly devout when it comes any particular diety. He will participate in worship activities for Halea, Larani, Peoni, and Save-K'nor, depending on circumstances. He's very flexible. But if forced to pick only one, he would probably choose Save-K'nor, so that's the church he has joined. I roll 18 piety points.

## Occupation

According to Stefan's original background, his mother was a cook/servant, so I don't roll to choose family occupation. But Stefan doesn't have the same occupation as his mother. In order to double-down on the educated bits, I choose to make Stefan a sage.

## Assignment of Skills

### Automatic Skills

Stefan's automatic skills are:

Skill          SB  ML
------------- --- ---
Climbing       13  52
Condition      12  60
Jumping        13  52
Stealth        16  48
Throwing       14  56
Awareness      15  60
Intrigue       14  42
Oratory        14  28
Rhetoric       16  48
Singing        15  45
L: Harnic      16  96
R: Save-Knor   17  17
Initiative     14  56
Unarmed        13  52

### Occupational Skills

Sage occupational skills, including option selections:

Skill           SB  ML
-------------- --- ---
Folklore        17  85
L: History      16  64
L: Geography    16  64
L: Zoology      16  64
Mathematics     17  34
L: Old Harnic   16  48
S: Lakise       15  85
S: Runic        15  85

Stefan's age is now 14 + 5 = 19.

### Family Skills

Servant skills are interesting. Stefan automatically gets Intrigue at OML + SB. The next best option on the list is Rhetoric, which is an automatic skill. Since it's already at OML, it gets bumped to OML + SB.

Their MLs go up to 56 and 64, respectively.

### Optional Skills

I pick the Militia option to allow two free weapon skills at OML + SB, choosing Spear and Dagger.

To round out Stefan's language skills, I spend 2 option points to open both Jarinese and Old Jarinese to SBx2. I spend 2 option points to add Acting and increase it once. The last point raises Jarinese once.

New option skills are:

Skill             SB  ML
---------------- --- ---
Dagger            14  56
Spear             13  52
L: Jarinese       16  48
L: Old Jarinese   16  32
Acting            16  32

### Veteran Skills

Since Stefan is 23 years old, that gives him 4 years of experience for a total of 12 veteran option points. I start by spending 3 points to raise each non-native language. Old Jarinese goes to 48, with the other two at 64. I then spend 3 more to raise Initiative and the weapon skills by SB. I spend another 3 to raise Acting by 2xSB. The last three raise Intrigue, Oratory, Rhetoric.

Stefan's final skills are:

Skill             SB  ML Skill             SB  ML Skill             SB  ML
---------------- --- --- ---------------- --- --- ---------------- --- ---
Climbing          13  52 Acting            16  64 Folklore          17  85
Condition         12  60 Awareness         15  60 L: Geography      16  64
Jumping           13  52 Intrigue          14  70 L: History        16  64
Stealth           16  48 Oratory           14  42 L: Zoology        16  64
Throwing          14  56 Rhetoric          16  80 Mathematics       17  34
                         Singing           15  45
Initiative        14  70 L: Harnic         16  96 R: Save-Knor      17  17
Unarmed           13  52 L: Jarinese       16  64
Dagger            14  70 L: Old Harnic     16  64
Spear             13  65 L: Old Jarinese   16  48
                         S: Lakise         15  85
                         S: Runic          15  85

### Psionic Skills

Stefan didn't have any arcane powers or psionics in the original, so I skip generation of those skills.

## Equipment and Funds

As a veteran character of 4 years, Stefan has 1,008d \* 4 years \* 14% = 564.5d rounded to the nearest farthing. That's more than enough to get some good wool traveling clothes and miscellaneous accessories, but not too much in the way of arms and armor.

## Friends and Enemies

With an age of 23, he should have a total of 5 friends/enemies. We know two from his background already: his patron and an enemy. I roll randomly for the other three.

- Lady Thessaly is a minor noble. She is an acquaintance with loyalty of 46.
- Santorelli is a lieutenant in the Lia-Kavair. He's an enemy.
- Other. An acquaintance with loyalty of 42.
- Knight-Bachelor/Lady. Unfriendly with loyalty of 12.
- Journeyman Chandler. Friend with loyalty of 69.

## Wrapping Up

I'm getting lazy, so I won't repeat all the attributes and skills from the previous sections. I skipped buying all of the equipment and naming the friends and enemies, too. In a real game, I would of course do all of the above and flesh out more background information as well.

## Conclusion

I managed to get a bit closer to the original Stefan than I expected to, but it's still not quite the same character. The skills aren't as close as I'd like, especially the weapon skills, but he definitely fits better in H창rn than the original would have.
