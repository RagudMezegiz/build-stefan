# Fantasy AGE

Fantasy AGE is the generic version of the Dragon Age RPG. It has the expected generic fantasy setting and baked-in assumptions. Despite being a class/level system, the focuses, talents, and specializations lend the game a certain amount of flexibility not found in the typical examples.

## Character Creation

### Abilities

I use Option 2 to buy abilities. I spend 7 points to raise everything except Constitution and Fighting to 1. I spend the rest to raise Communication, Dexterity, and Intelligence to 2. With 9 abilities and only 10 points, there are not enough points to go around.

### Race

Stefan is human. Fighting goes up to 1. I pick Swimming for the focus. I pretend to have rolled 6 and 9, so he gets the Persuasion and Deception focuses.

### Background

Instead of rolling, I pick the middle-class background of Student, with the focus of Research.

### Class

The only appropriate class for Stefan is Rogue. I choose bow for the weapon group and of course choose Contacts for his talent.

### Equipment

As a rogue, Stefan gets a backpack, traveler's garb, a waterskin, light leather armor, two weapons, and 50+3d6 silver. I choose a short sword and crossbow for the weapons, and roll 7 for a total of 57 silver. Aside from a pouch to hold his money, I choose to not buy any equipment at this time. He has 56 silver and 2 copper remaining.

## Conclusion

Without actually trying the game, I can't be certain how close this comes to Stefan's original abilities. He feels slightly underpowered in comparison, but on par with equivalent teammates that would have been created with these rules. And while he's not quite the same Stefan, I am somewhat impressed by the flexibility of the character creation rules.
