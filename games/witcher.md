# The Witcher

The Witcher is a challenging setting for a character like Stefan, given that the vast majority of threats are not really capable of being conned or reasoned with. So in a hunt, accompanying a Witcher, he's not really in his element. But prior to the action, he could be immensely useful in gathering information and other such activities.

## Pick Your Race

Stefan is human.

## Run a Lifepath

The closest analogue to Landmoor in the world of the Witcher is Novigrad, so I choose his heritage instead of rolling. He is from Redania.

Stefan's only known parent was alive, so I simply choose to skip the family and parental fate rolls.

None of the family status options are an exact match, so I choose Merchant as the closest analogue. That gives Stefan two acquaintances. Rolling on the allies tables provides these allies:

- Male Priest, Met While Drunk, Currently in the Elder Lands
- Male Childhood Friend, Met While Traveling, Currently in the Northern Kingdoms

The Mage seems the best choice for most influential friend. Stefan was never one to be exceptionally superstitious, especially about magic.

Stefan is an only child.

With an age of 23, Stefan will have 2 significant life events. In a departure from the attempts to get as close as possible to the original character, I decide to roll for the life events. But any results that seem particularly out of place will be rerolled.

When I get an Enemy, I pick the details to match his original enemy except for Power, which I roll. (Male, Bandit, Humiliation, Stefan's fault, Power 1, Will Attack, Minions)

The second result is Fell in With Bandits. That's not a bad substitute for his original criminal gang.

Stefan's personal style runs to utilitarian clothing with no particular affectations, short hair, and a friendly demeanor.

## Pick Your Profession

I briefly toy with the idea of being a Bard before returning to my first choice of Criminal. And then after reading the skill trees, return to Bard.

Stefan's profession skill levels are:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD035 -->

**Skill**                 **Lvl**
------------------------ --------
Busking                         6
Charisma                        6
Deceit                          6
Performance (Acting)            1
Language (Elder Speech)         2
Human Perception                6
Streetwise                      6
Fine Arts                       1
Seduction                       2
Social Etiquette                6

The free gear picks are:

- Dice poker board
- Flask of spirits
- Dagger
- Belt pouch
- Journal with lock

## Pick Your Statistics

Rather than roll, I decide to choose one of the point buy options and finally settle on Skilled. After spending points, Stefan's statistics are:

INT\ 8, REF\ 8, DEX\ 8, BODY\ 6, SPD\ 8, EMP\ 10, CRA\ 6, WILL\ 9, LUCK\ 7

## Select Pick-Up Skills

With INT and REF of 8 each, Stefan has 16 points available for pick-up skills. These have to include all his combat skills, since a Bard doesn't start with any. The skills I want are Awareness, Education, Brawling, Dodge/Escape, Riding, Small Blades, Swordsmanship, Athletics, Crossbow, Stealth, Gambling, Persuasion, First Aid, Forgery, Courage, and Resist Coercion. That's a total of 16 skills, and I'd like to have higher than 1 in some of them.

Without enough points to get everything, I concentrate on skills that Stefan should be good at. I'm not happy with the final values, but settle for these skills:

**Skill**         **Lvl**
---------------- --------
Awareness               3
Dodge/Escape            2
Swordsmanship           2
Crossbow                2
Gambling                4
Persuasion              3

## Get Your Coin

I choose the average result for coin and get 840 crowns.

## Outfit Yourself

First cut at gear, excluding the free career items, is an Arming Sword, Crossbow, 10 bolts, Gambeson, Bedroll, Candles, Flint & Steel, and a Waterskin. That's a total of 870 crowns, which is more than I have. Replacing the crossbow with a hand crossbow saves 170, leaving Stefan with 140 crowns in his purse for food and lodging.

Here's the final character:

## Conclusion

This version of Stefan is at the start of what will be a career as a master spy by going down the Informant skill tree. He's not quite the same as the original Stefan, but is about as close as I can get without spending a bunch of experience. I didn't have to diverge as much as I was fearing, but definitely more than I wanted.
