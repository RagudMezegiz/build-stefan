# Fate Core

Fate should be more than capable of allowing me to create a reasonable version of Stefan.  Since I'm not creating him in a group for an actual campaign, I'll just fill in all the parts without the crossover stories.

## Character Idea

Stefan is a gambler and con-man, educated, and not bad in a fight.  But what's the most stand-out thing that describes him in a single phrase?  Whatever that is should be his High Concept.  Since I don't want to spend too much time on it, I fairly quickly settle for ***Scholarly Con-Man***.

His Trouble is far easier, since he has an obvious enemy: ***Santorelli's gang wants payback***.  The phrasing leaves it open as to whether they want him dead, humiliated, severely beaten, or something else.  But whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.

## The Phase Trio

Instead of writing stories that intersect with other characters whose players I don't have handy, I'll just come up with three aspects that fit Stefan's character.  ***Jack of all trades, master of some*** and ***Why work yourself, when you can get others to do it for you*** come very quickly to mind.  The third one takes a bit more work, until I realize I don't have an aspect relating to his excellent gambling skill.  However, his gambling skill comes from his ability to read people, and a phrasing comes to mind: ***Reads people as easily as books***.

## Skills

Lots of hemming, hawing, and tweaking occur before I finally settle on this skill pyramid:

Great:

: Rapport

Good:

: Deceive, Empathy

Fair:

: Fight, Lore, Shoot

Average:

: Athletics, Notice, Stealth, Will

There are at least five more skills I wanted, but there are only so many slots.  Things like Burglary, Contacts, and Investigate will have to wait for advances.

## Stunts

I decide to stick with the basic three stunts so as not to eat into starting Refresh.

Face in the Crowd

: +2 to any Stealth roll to blend into a crowd.

Lie Whisperer

: +2 to all Empathy rolls to discern or discover lies.

Mind Games

: You can use Deceive in place of Provoke to make mental attacks, as long as you can make up a clever lie as part of the attack.

## Stress and Consequences

With Mediocre (+0) Physique and Average (+1) Will, Stefan has the default 2 physical stress boxes and 3 mental stress boxes.  He has no extra consequences slots.

## Finishing Up

Here's the final character sheet:

: Stefan Meronson

Aspects:

: ***Scholarly con-man***\
  ***Santorelli's gang wants payback***\
  ***Jack of all trades, master of some***\
  ***Why work yourself, when you can get others to do it for you***\
  ***Reads people as easily as books***

Skills:

: Great (+4) Rapport\
  Good (+3) Deceive, Empathy\
  Fair (+2) Fight, Lore, Shoot\
  Average (+1) Athletics, Notice, Stealth, Will

Stress:

: 2 physical boxes, 3 mental boxes

Stunts:

: **Face in the Crowd**: +2 to any Stealth roll to blend into a crowd.\
  **Lie Whisperer**: +2 to all Empathy rolls to discern or discover lies.\
  **Mind Games**: You can use Deceive in place of Provoke to make mental attacks, as long as you can make up a clever lie as part of the attack.

## Conclusion

As expected, Stefan was fairly easy to recreate.  It's not exactly the same character, but close enough that I think he'd feel about the same in play.
