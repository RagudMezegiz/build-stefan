# Blades in the Dark

A game all about criminals seems to be ready made to support a character who started as a criminal. Duskvol is a lot like Landmoor in many respects, but the world itself is quite a bit darker in both tone and natural illumination. There will be some differences in both background and personality, but I'm hoping it will support a "mirror universe" version of the character.

## Choose a Playbook

As a con man and social manipulator, Stefan is obviously a Slide. Later in his original life, he may have wound up converting to a Spider, but he definitely started as a Slide.

## Choose a Heritage

As a native, he should be of Akorosian heritage. "Servants to the wealthy" is chosen as the family life detail.

## Choose a Background

For background, I choose Academic as the closest that matches the original. Doskvol Academy is a little too well-connected, so I go with "Charterhall University student."

## Assign Four Action Dots

Stefan starts with 1 Consort and 2 Sway already, which is perfect. The background dot is easy; it's Study. The heritage pick comes from the servant part, and I pick Survey.

The last two dots go into Skirmish and Prowl. I also want Finesse, but I think the other two will be more useful more often.

## Choose a Special Ability

This is the hardest choice made so far. Half of them are perfect. The choices come down to either Like Looking Into a Mirror or A Little Something on the Side. Both are perfect, representing his ability to read people and his confidence games and scams.

In the end, I go with Like Looking Into a Mirror.

## Choose One Close Friend and One Rival

I choose Klyra the tavern owner as the good friend. The potential to acquire choice info and have a friendly place to hang out makes her the best choice.

The gang leader is the closest analog to Santorelli from Stefan's original history, but having read ahead, choosing Bazso as an enemy/rival would mean he couldn't work with the Lampblacks against the Red Sashes should the game start with the default setup.^[Such a game probably wouldn't occur, but I can't help metagaming now and then. It's deeply embedded into my nature.] Knowing that I won't be choosing Stupor as my vice, I decide on Bryl the drug dealer instead.

## Choose Your Vice

There's really no choice here; it has to be Gambling. I decide to go with Helene as my purveyor, as her casino is the most attractive option.

## Record Your Name, Alias, and Look

From the name lists, Stev Morriston is pretty close, so let's go with that. I decide he has no aliases that have stuck, but probably several alternate names used for cons and the like.

Physically, he's rather ordinary in appearance, dressed in whatever passes as "normal" for the area of the city he's operating in.

## Review Your Details

That was incredibly simple. He's really close to the original Stefan in abilities given the limitations of the game, and close enough in outlook that I'm okay with him.

That said, were I to play him in a game I would not directly advertise that it's Stefan in alternative clothing. Because he sure as hell would not stay that way for very long.
