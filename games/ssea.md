# 7^th^ Sea 2^nd^ Edition

7^th^ Sea is a game of swashbuckling adventure in the land of Théah.  Like the Mistborn Adventure Game, it's set in a specific world rather than being a generic fantasy setting.  But, like Scadrial, Stefan has many qualities that would fit well in Théah.  Much of his background can exist mostly as written.  I'll adjust his background as needed when I answer the twenty questions.

## Concept

### What Nation is your Hero from?

In attitude, at least, Stefan's original home of Landmoor is probably closest to Vodacce.  Greed, betrayal, romance, and hedonism are a fine mix of "virtues".

Stefan is not a particularly Vodacce-sounding name, but Stefano is.  For the rest of this section, he'll be Stefano.

### How would you physically describe your Hero?

Stefano is average in both height and weight, with unremarkable brown hair and eyes.  He deliberately dresses in the same style as everyone around him so as not to stand out.  He tries hard to be forgettable in appearance.

### Does your Hero have recurring mannerisms?

He is quieter than most Vodacce men.  He doesn't engage in as much braggadocio or womanizing as one would expect.

### What is your Hero's main motivation?

He is definitely a child of his culture; he is driven to the accumulation of wealth.  He wants the wealth mostly so he can live a life of luxury and not have to work.

### What is your Hero's greatest strength?  Greatest weakness?

Stefano is very good at reading people.  It is a skill that serves him well, especially in gambling.

Stefano is quite lazy, and doesn't care for any kind of manual labor.  Reading and research don't count, however, and he'll happily spend hours in a library sifting through musty tomes for hidden knowledge.

### What are your Hero's most and least favorite things?

One may be forgiven for thinking that Stefano's favorite thing is money.  But it's not the money itself he loves; it's the things the money can buy.

His least favorite thing is manual labor.  He's spent an awful lot of his life figuring out how to avoid it.

### What about your Hero's psychology?

### What is your Hero's single greatest fear?

### What are your Hero's highest ambitions?  His greatest love?

If Stefano could live forever, he would.  As long as he could live in some form of luxury, anyway.  Although he figures that he'll be rich by the time he figures out how to live forever.

### What is your Hero's opinion of his country?

Although he is not a vocal patriot, Stefano believes that Vodacce is the greatest Nation in Théah.  But his pride is in Vodacce itself, not any of its people.

### Does your Hero have any prejudices?

Not really, but he does often wish the Vaticine church would stick to educating and skip all the religion and inquisition stuff.

### Where do your Hero's loyalties lie?

With his friends and comrades.

### Is your Hero in love?  Is he married or betrothed?

Stefano has not found love yet.  Nor does he have an arranged marriage to either endure or avoid.

### What about your Hero's family?

Although Stefano never met him and doesn't even know who he is, his father was a Buccaneer captain with a small streak of altruism.  His mother is a housekeeper in a lyceum.

Stefano grew up in the lyceum, learning as if he were one of the wealthy students who attended.

### How would your Hero's parents describe him?

### Is your Hero a gentle?

Not even close.  He feels a code as constraining as chivalry is too much of a hindrance to bother with.

### How religious is your Hero?  What sect of the Church does he follow?

He pays lip service to the Vaticine church, and pretends to be devout when it would provide an advantage, but isn't really a believer.

### Is your Hero a member of a guild, gentle's club, or secret society?

The Explorer's Society is a natural fit.

### What does your Hero think of Sorcery?

It's a very useful tool.  As for the wielders, they're people and should be evaluated on an individual basis.

### If you could, what advice would you give your Hero?

## Traits

Stefano is charming and smart, so his 2 additional points raise Wits and Panache.

## Nation Bonus

With a choice between Finesse and Resolve, I choose Finesse.  In GURPS, Stefan's DX was as high as his IQ.  Resolve would probably be the first Trait to raise through a story.

## Backgrounds

One background is an easy choice: Esploratore from the Vodacce list.  The second takes a lot longer to decide on.  I finally settle on Courtier.  Obviously, this version of the character is much more highly-placed in society than the original.

His Quirks are:

- Earn a Hero Point when you turn the tide of violence with charm and flair.
- Earn a Hero Point when you use non-Théan items or knowledge to solve a problem.

The first, from the Courtier background, is liable to generate a lot of Hero Points; that's pretty much his preference.  Fighting is usually more dangerous than talking, and Stefano tends to be fairly careful.

I'll worry about the Skills and Advantages the backgrounds provide in the next sections.

## Skills

His backgrounds provide the following skills:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD035 -->

----------- --
Convince     1
Empathy      2
Intimidate   1
Perform      1
Ride         1
Sailing      1
Tempt        2
Weaponry     1
----------- --

The first thing to do is buy the skills I want that are missing: Athletics, Hide, Notice, and Scholarship.  That's 4 points.  Raising Convince and Empathy to 3 is 3 more.  The last 3 points raise Perform to 2 and Weaponry to 3.

## Advantages

From his Backgrounds, he has the following advantages:

- An Honest Misunderstanding
- Friend at Court
- Linguist
- Lyceum

Fencer and Streetwise are obvious choices, and cost exactly 5 points together.

## Arcana

Stefano's Virtue comes from The Prophet: Illuminating---Activate your Virtue to know whenever any other character lies to you until the end of the Scene.

His Hubris comes from The Witch: Manipulative---You receive a Hero Point when you try to get someone else to do your dirty work for you, and it backfires.

## Stories

Before figuring out what story I want Stefano to pursue, I need to decide what the reward will be.  Stefano would obviously love to have the Rich Advantage, but I decide that Patron has more future story potential (and could easily be a stepping-stone to Rich).  Patron and Rich are both 3-point Advantages, so Stefano's story needs to have 3 steps.

Let's title it "Immortality" (probably not the last story to have that title).  It ends with Stefano realizing the so-called immortal alchemist's formulary doesn't contain an immortality elixer he can use, so he sells it to Vincenzo Caligari.  The first step is "Find out the location of a supposedly immortal alchemist."

## Details

Stefano has no reputation yet.  His Linguist advantage lets him speak, read, and write every language in Théah.  And we determined earlier that he was a member of the Explorer's Society.  He has no Wealth yet, because he hasn't yet earned his Patron advantage.

## Finishing Up

Here's the final character sheet:

## Conclusion

This is not the same character as the original, but he seems to have the same spirit.  He morphed quite a bit as I answered the questions.  I like him a lot, and would be happy to play him in a real game.
