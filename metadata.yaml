title: Building Stefan Meronson

  One of the things I do to test the flexibility of a fantasy game system is to
  build a starting version of one of my old GURPS characters: Stefan Meronson.
  Stefan was intelligent, sociable, and handy to have in a fight.  If a game
  system can build a reasonable version of Stefan as a beginning character, it
  should be flexible enough to build damn near anybody.
