# Original Version

## Background

Stefan grew up in the College of Arcane Lore in Landmoor; his mother was the housekeeper. Although he had no magical talent, he learned enough about magic and the ways of magicians to be comfortable in their presence; even the creepy lady who spoke to dead people.

Behind the college was the city's only public stables inside the walls.  Stefan got to play with the horses frequently while growing up, and learned to both ride and care for them.

When he got old enough to pick a career for himself, he chose none of the things he did growing up.  He'd become rather lazy, and wanted a career where he didn't have to actually do anything.  He became a gambler and con man.  He was good enough at gambling to provide himself some spending money, but it was the scams that provided the real cash.  At least until one of them went wrong, that is.

Landmoor had a tunnel system.  Most folks weren't aware of it, but Stefan was thanks to the entrance inside the college.  Some of the criminal gangs in the city knew of it, too.  Stefan got the bright idea to sell tunnel maps to the criminals.  What he didn't bother to tell the criminals was that he'd made them up instead of actually exploring.  When the gang he'd sold maps to tried to track him down, he fled into the service of one he hadn't sold maps to as protection.
